# Function: yieldExec()

> **yieldExec**(): `Promise`\<`void`\>

Defined in: [src/sleep.ts:28](https://github.com/isdk/util.js/blob/40caefda2d376f288af37d8babc9da0357d94056/src/sleep.ts#L28)

Yields execution control to the event loop, allowing pending I/O operations
and scheduled tasks to run before continuing.

## Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

## Remarks

This method creates a microtask checkpoint using `setImmediate`, which helps:
- Interleave CPU-intensive work with I/O events
- Prevent event loop blocking
- Maintain application responsiveness

Particularly useful for breaking up long synchronous operations in Node.js.
